        Hello! Welcome to our project. Our project will be examining the need for increased implementation of solar
        panels. Installing solar panels on your home helps combat greenhouse gas emissions and reduces our need to use
        fossil fuels. Installing solar panels is also cheaper for individual families. Estimated savings over 20 years
        after solar purchase is $7,000 (Project Sunroof). Project Horizon is a user-friendly consultation to estimate how
        much switching to solar energy would save your household.

        <h3 id='h3'>Solar Panel prices increase your home value!</h3>
        <p id='homevalue'>On average, homeowners see an increase in value by about 4.1% or roughly $15,000 in their home
            value. In some
            areas where the median home cost is higher or solar is more valued, you can expect to see even more of an
            increase in value. </p>
